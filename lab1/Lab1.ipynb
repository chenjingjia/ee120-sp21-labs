    "Suppose you are given 2 discrete time signal $x[n]$ and $y[n]$ of arbitraty length. Denote the cross correlation of $x[n]$ and $y[n]$ as $$R_{x,y}[n] = x[n]\\circ y[n] = \\sum_k x[k]y[k + n].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, we will implement a function to calculate the cross correlation between two signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will have to give some thought to the dimensions of the input and output signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For the implementation of this, there are a few things you should keep in mind:\n",
    "1. What will the length of the output signal be in terms of $N = \\text{len}(x[n])$ and $M = \\text{len}(y[n])$? If you aren't sure, try correlating a few length-2 or 3 signals manually and see what the length of the output is (where is it nonzero?).\n",
    "2. Each index $n$ of the correlation is the element-wise multiplication of $x[k]$ with a version of $y[k]$ shifted $n$ to the left. In order to implement this easily using Numpy, we must <b> zero-pad </b> our signals to target output signal length, i.e. concatenate $x[k]$ and $y[k]$ with arrays of zeros using <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.concatenate.html\"> np.concarenate</a>.\n",
    "  * Think of the first index of the cross correlation function, which corresponds to the smallest $n$ such that the correlation is nonzero. For how many indices to the left or right of $x[k]$ does $y[k + n]$ extend? Zero-pad $x[k]$ by that amount. For instance, if $y[k + n]$ extends 1 index past the right of $x[k]$, you would add one $0$ to the right of $x$.\n",
    "  * Follow the same process for the last index of the convolution.\n",
    "  * Finally, how can you zero-pad $y$ so that it is the same length of $x$? Does it make sense to pad $y$ with zeros to the left or the right? The padding for $y$ will need to change as you will need to \"slide\" $y[k]$ along the axis of $k$ in order to calculate for different $n$."

    "We have loaded an three-dimension array of data named \"fMRI\". The three dimensions are x, y and time. The data was acquired while the subject performed an auditory guided finger tapping experiment. A blocked design scheme was used: 15 seconds rest, 15 seconds finger tapping, 15 seconds rest, 15 seconds, finger tapping,... repeat until 6 min is reached. Every 3 seconds, we acquire the brain image data once. Therefore, in total, 6 min, we have 120 brain slice images, and 30 seconds is the period of the task (input)."
